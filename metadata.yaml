description: During World War I, Washington, D.C. society girl Nancy Craddock decides
  to enlist in the army of the Food Administration on the theory that "eggs will win
  the war." Accompanied by her grandfather, Col. William Craddock, Nancy buys some
  chickens and goes to the Maryland farm of her uncle, Major J. Craddock. There she
  meets Adam Baldwin, an army officer who has been assigned to study agricultural
  conditions in the Harpeth District incognito, and he soon diverts her attention
  from Matthew Berry, a suitor whom she had promised to marry on condition that he
  enlist in the army. Posing as a farmhand, Adam begins the work of reclaiming the
  Harpeth Valley, but incurs the enmity of local farmers, who suspect that he is a
  slacker. Nancy willingly assists him until Matthew appears in uniform and demands
  that she fulfill her promise, whereupon Adam, discouraged, leaves the farm. Matthew
  falls in love with Polly Beasley, and, in the end, Nancy discovers Adam's true identity,
  and they marry, while Matthew weds Polly.
